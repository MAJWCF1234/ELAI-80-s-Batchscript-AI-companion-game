this is a conversation module these get stacked with hundreds and end in exit /B 0 so it can be stacked
The first label is what the user says
for example
:hielai

as you can see it has no spaces capitals or punctuation so the user can type it in any variation and it can be called

echo Placeholder for Elai's response
exit /B 0

Each conversation module starts with a label representing a user prompt or input (e.g., :letstalkaboutclientsidescripting).
Each label after the first in a module has the same m-tag (e.g., m_0000250) at the end to indicate that they are an expansion of the initial section.
The m-tag remains consistent within a module, but can vary between different modules.
The initial label represents the user prompt or question to initiate the conversation on a specific topic.
All conversation modules should provide a dynamic and interactive conversation experience, allowing users to engage in a dialogue.
Labels within the same module can be linked together using goto statements to create a flow within that module.
Labels in different modules can also be linked together using goto statements to transition between different parts of the conversation.
The conversation modules can be exited using the exit /B 0 command.
